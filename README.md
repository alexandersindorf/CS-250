# How do I interperate user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
#  Initially, user needs are interperated in the initial planning of the project.  When meeting with the client, the vision of the project is reviewed,
#  and a mission statement is created.  After establishing criteria for success, the team can move forward in that general direction.  Interviewing end
#  users provides specific tasks or features to implement into the program.  These "user stories" can be defined in the scope of the project, and stored
#  in the user backlog.  The repository allows for better planning during a sprint planning phase and for day to day tasks.
# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
#  Developing programs from an independant level can use processes from the agile methodology.  The will be a planning phase, and development, and testing,
#  etc.  Afterall, the end goal is the same; to make a program.  Agile has taught me how to develop incrementally, and how to develop usable software
#  throughout the development process.  I can also see how agile would be useful in a scenario where support and updates are provided to a product after
#  it's initial release.
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
#  I think that the traits of a god software development team member are the same as a good member of any other team.  Carrying a sense of self responsibility
#  on an individual, team, and project level is key to success.  Professionalism, communication, openness, and helpfulness are all good traits to have while
#  participating in a software development team
